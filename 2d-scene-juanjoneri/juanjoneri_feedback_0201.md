#### Grader: Sirseim and Eko

#### Grading Notes:
The 100-point total is based on 10 points for _Version Control_ and 30 points each for the major functional points (three sprites, parameterization, and animation). The other categories hold _deductions only_ if an issue was noticed along those lines. Parentheticals indicate the specific course outcome(s) covered, as listed in the syllabus.

| | Points | Comments |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| *Punctuality (4f)* |  | Start Date: 1/21/2017 End Date: 2/1/2017 |
| *Version Control (4e)* | 10 | 64 commits |
| *Code Style (4c)* |  | Error count: N/A, Error type: N/A |
| *Best Practices (4b)* | -2 | trivial parameters of initial x, y, and rotation should not be passed to sprite, but rather done in the surrounding animation mechanism; I can appreciate what you were attempting to do with indenting code between `save()` and `restore()` but indentation is reserved for a change in scope. You can accmplish a similar goal by having a wrapping function that will handle the save and restore and call a passed in function. Ask Dondi or Edward Seim if this needs further explanation |
| *Three Sprites (2a, 3a, 4a)* | 30 |  |
| *Parameterized Sprites (2a, 3a, 4a)* | 30 |  |
| *Functional Animation (3b, 4a)* | 30 |  |
| **TOTAL** | 98 |
