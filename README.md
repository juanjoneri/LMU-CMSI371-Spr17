## Computer Graphics

### Learning Outcomes

This course explores the computer science subfield of computer graphicsâ€”the study and development ofalgorithms for synthesizing, manipulating, and displaying visual information. Long after the course concludes, my hope is that you will be able to:
1. Represent, model, and create visual information digitally.
2. Manipulate and display visual information in 2D and 3D.
3. Use and develop computer graphics APIs in both 2D and 3D. 
In addition to the course-specific content, you are also expected to:
4. Follow disciplinary best practices throughout the course.
